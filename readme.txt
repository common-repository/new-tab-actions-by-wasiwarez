Adds row actions to WordPress post and page list tables for executing in new tab

== Description ==
This plugin adds row actions to WordPress list tables. In this version it adds the edit and the view link for opening in new tab. Currently this is only added to the post and the page list table. There will be additional links inside the table rows. Next to the edit link there will be an edit (New tab) link. Next to the view link there will be a view (new tab) link.

This plugin is really small and it´s functions are executed only, if you are on the WordPress post or page edit page. So it doesn´t even reduce the performance of your site.

== Installation ==
Just activate the plugin. The action links will be added automatically. There is no settings or help page of this plugin.
